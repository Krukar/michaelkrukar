# MichaelKrukar.com Redesign May 2014

To Do

- Find out how to load Youtube video only when it's been clicked (Videos are no longer emebeds but now API generated)
- Load all scripts async (because it's cool)
- Lock text so that they don't scroll (cool but not necessary)
- Fix fullscreen panelsnap bug or disable fullscreen (don't like disabling fullscreen)
