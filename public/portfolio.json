The costume is just a classic red track suit, dyed blonde hair and a tiny amount of makeup to look more cartoony. A few people recognized me, some thought I was the Six Million Dollar man. Photo inspired by George Costanza."

As long as you do some actual work, that's the key. Roy Fox Lichtenstein was an American pop artist. During the 1960s, along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquist among others, he became a leading figure in the new art movement. Harley Quinn (Harleen Frances Quinzel) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman and commonly as the Joker's sidekick."
